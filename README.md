# Weather Dashboard 
The current project is an interactive weather dashboard incorporating the google maps API and open weather API. The user can enter the desired location which will update the pin on the map, display the following weather for 5 days along with extra weather information. The application uses local storage to save certain locations which can be revisited by clicking on the saved location below the map. The application is responsive to smaller screen sizes. 


## Project Requirements
  
* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
* Use at least two server-side APIs.
* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
* Be responsive.
* Have a polished UI.
* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application)
