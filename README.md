# Weather Dashboard 

The current project is an interactive weather dashboard incorporating the google maps API and open weather API. The user can enter the desired location which will update the pin on the map, display the following weather for 5 days along with extra weather information. The application uses local storage to save certain locations which can be revisited by clicking on the saved location below the map. The application is responsive to smaller screen sizes.
